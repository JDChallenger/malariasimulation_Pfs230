### Plotting functions
We will create a few plotting functions to visualise the output.
```{r}
cols <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", 
          "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

# Plotting functions
plot_prev <- function() {
  plot(x = output$timestep, y = output$n_detect_730_3650 / output$n_730_3650, 
       type = "l", col = cols[3], lwd = 2.5,
       xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = expression(paste(italic(Pf),"PR"[2-10])),
       xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", bty = "l", ylim = c(0,1))
  lines(x = output_all$timestep, y = output_all$n_detect_730_3650 / output_all$n_730_3650,
        col = cols[5], lwd = 2.5)
  abline(v = sprayingtimesteps, lty = 2, lwd = 2.5, col = "black")
  grid(lty = 2, col = "grey80", lwd = 1)
  legend("bottomleft", box.lty = 0, legend = c("Spraying", "Prevalence for species-specific scenario", "Prevalence for default all mosquitoes scenario"),
         col = c("black", cols[3], cols[5]), lty = c(2,1,1), lwd = 2.5)
}
```
    
As alluded to in the IRS and Bed net vignettes, it is possible to account for varying proportions of mosquito species in the setting you are modelling using the `set_species()` function. IRS and bed nets could be expected to have different impacts depending on the proportion of each mosquito species because of variations in indoor resting, insecticide resistance, and proportion of bites on humans versus animals by species. If you have specified more than 1 species, then the arguments for `set_spraying()` and/or `set_bednets()` must be populated with values for each species at each timestep that the intervention is implemented. 

There are preset parameters for *An. gambiae*, *An. arabiensis*, and *An. funestus* that can be set by the helper functions `gamb_params()`, `arab_params()`, and `fun_params()`, respectively. The default values for each species in these helper functions are from [Sherrard-Smith et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820646116). The parameters are:  

* `blood_meal_rates`: the blood meal rates for each species 
* `foraging_time`: time spent taking blood meals    
* `Q0`: proportion of blood meals taken on humans  
* `phi_bednets`: proportion of bites taken in bed    
* `phi_indoors`: proportion of bites taken indoors    

We will demonstrate how to specify different mosquito species and how this could alter intervention impact using an example with IRS.

## IRS with default mosquito settings

Use the `get_parameters()` function to generate a list of parameters, accepting most of the default values, but modifying seasonality values to model a seasonal setting. We will model IRS with the default mosquito settings, which is to model all mosquito species together. Then, we use the `set_equilibrium()` function to to initialise the model at a given entomological inoculation rate (EIR). 

```{r}
year <- 365
month <- 30
sim_length <- 3 * year
human_population <- 1000
starting_EIR <- 50

simparams <- get_parameters(
  list(
    human_population = human_population,
    # seasonality parameters
    model_seasonality = TRUE, 
    g0 = 0.285277,
    g = c(-0.0248801, -0.0529426, -0.0168910),
    h = c(-0.0216681, -0.0242904, -0.0073646)
  )
)

peak <- peak_season_offset(simparams)

sprayingtimesteps <- c(1, 2) * year + peak - 3 * month # There is a round of IRS in the 1st and second year 3 months prior to peak transmission.

simparams <- set_spraying(
  simparams,
  timesteps = sprayingtimesteps,
  coverages = rep(.8, 2), # # Each round covers 80% of the population 
  # nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species) 
  ls_theta = matrix(2.025, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=1), # Matrix of mortality parameters per round of IRS and per species 
  ls_gamma = matrix(-0.009, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=1), # Matrix of mortality parameters per round of IRS and per species
  ks_theta = matrix(-2.222, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=1), # Matrix of feeding success parameters per round of IRS and per species
  ks_gamma = matrix(0.008, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=1), # Matrix of feeding success parameters per round of IRS and per species
  ms_theta = matrix(-1.232, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=1), # Matrix of deterrence parameters per round of IRS and per species
  ms_gamma = matrix(-0.009, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=1) # Matrix of deterrence parameters per round of IRS and per species
)

simparams <- set_equilibrium(simparams, starting_EIR)

# Running simulation with no IRS
output_all <- run_simulation(timesteps = sim_length, parameters = simparams)
```

The default setting is to model all mosquito species together. 
```{r}
simparams$species
simparams$species_proportions
```

### Plot species over time
```{r,fig.align="center", fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
plot(x = output_all$timestep, y = output_all$Im_All_count,
     type = "l", col = cols[5], lwd = 2.5,
     xlab = "Time (days)", ylab = "N mosquitoes",
       xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", bty = "l")
abline(v = sprayingtimesteps, lty = 2, lwd = 2.5, col = "black")
grid(lty = 2, col = "grey80", lwd = 1)
legend("topright", box.lty = 0, legend = c("Spraying", "All mosquitoes"), col = c("black", cols[5]), lty = c(2, 1), lwd = 2.5)
```


## IRS with different mosquito species

We will run the same model with IRS as above, but this time with 3 species of mosquitoes: *An. arabiensis*, *An. gambiae*, and an example mosquito species similar to *An. funestus*, but with a lower propensity to bite indoors. Note that now there are 3 columns for the `ls_theta`, `ls_gamma`, `ks_theta`, `ks_gamma`, `ms_theta`, and `ms_gamma` arguments. Each column corresponds to a species of mosquito, and each row corresponds to the timestep when a round of IRS occurred. Here, we are assuming the same values for each species at each IRS round for simplicity, but the matrix could be edited to have different values by species or over time by adding new columns or rows. 

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# Create an example mosquito species with a low value for `phi_indoors`
example_mosquito_params <- fun_params
example_mosquito_params$phi_indoors <- 0.2
example_mosquito_params$species <- 'example'

## Set 3 species of mosquitoes, 10% An. arabiensis, 10% An. gambia, and 80% an example species with a lower propensity for indoor biting
simparams <- set_species(
  simparams, 
  species = list(arab_params, gamb_params, example_mosquito_params),
  proportions = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.6)
)

peak <- peak_season_offset(simparams)

sprayingtimesteps <- c(1, 2) * year + peak - 3 * month # There is a round of IRS in the 1st and second year 3 months prior to peak transmission.

simparams <- set_spraying(
  simparams,
  timesteps = sprayingtimesteps,
  coverages = rep(.8, 2), # # Each round covers 80% of the population 
  ls_theta = matrix(2.025, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=3), # Matrix of mortality parameters; nrows=length(timesteps), ncols=length(species) 
  ls_gamma = matrix(-0.009, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=3), # Matrix of mortality parameters per round of IRS and per species
  ks_theta = matrix(-2.222, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=3), # Matrix of feeding success parameters per round of IRS and per species
  ks_gamma = matrix(0.008, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=3), # Matrix of feeding success parameters per round of IRS and per species
  ms_theta = matrix(-1.232, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=3), # Matrix of deterrence parameters per round of IRS and per species
  ms_gamma = matrix(-0.009, nrow=length(sprayingtimesteps), ncol=3) # Matrix of deterrence parameters per round of IRS and per species
)

output <- run_simulation(timesteps = sim_length, parameters = simparams)
```

Here we can see that now there are 3 species of mosquitoes at the proportions we specified in `set_species()`.
```{r}
simparams$species
simparams$species_proportions
```

  
### Plot prevalence
In the plot below, we can see that IRS is much more effective when the default mosquito species are used compared to the scenario where we added an example mosquito species with a lower propensity for biting indoors. In this case, IRS will not be as effective because a larger proportion of bites take place outside of the home.

      col = cols[3], lwd = 2.5)

legend("topright", box.lty = 0, legend = c("Spraying", "Example mosquito species", expression(italic("An. arabiensis")), expression(italic("An. gambiae"))), col = c("black", cols[5], cols[6], cols[3]), lty = c(2, 1, 1, 1), lwd = 2.5)
```
