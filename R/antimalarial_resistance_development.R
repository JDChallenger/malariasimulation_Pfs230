##' README:
##' THis script is designed as a place to develop and store the changes being implemented into the
##' malariasimulation package in support of integrating antimalarial resistance. This file is
##' designed to be deleted prior to any merge and is purely for development purposes.

##' CURENTLY WORKING ON: amending the calculate_treated() function to update
##'
##'
##' Use Ctrl + Shft + C to comment everything in/out for load_all() to work

#----- 1) Preamble ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Load in the individual package:

#----- 2) Original calculate_treated() function ----------------------------------------------------

##' This is the original calculate_treated() function, renamed to avoid any conflicts.

#----- X) Notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##' If we are using a time-series of resistance proportions, we need a method for retrieving the up-
##' to-date proportions given the current time step and dates on which resistance values are updated.
##' For the time-varying deathrate, in create_mortality_process() (mortality_processes.R), the following
##' is used:
##'           last_deathrate <- match_timestep(parameters$deathrate_timesteps, timestep)
##'
##' We can use the same method in the following way:
##'
##'           latest_resistance <- match_timestep(unlist(parameters$antimalarial_resistance_timesteps),
##'                                               current_timestep)
