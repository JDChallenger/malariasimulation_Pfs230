\title{Parameterise an indoor spraying strategy}
\usage{
set_spraying(parameters, timesteps, coverages)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{timesteps}{the timesteps at which to spray}

\item{coverages}{the proportion of the population who get indoor
spraying}
}
\description{
The model will apply indoor spraying at \code{timesteps} to a random
sample of the entire human population. The sample size will be a proportion
of the human population taken from the corresponding \code{coverages}.
The sample \emph{can} contain humans who have already benefitted from spraying.

If a human in the sample lives in a sprayed house, the efficacy of the
spraying will be returned to the maximum.
