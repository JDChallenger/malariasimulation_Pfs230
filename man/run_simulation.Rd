\usage{
run_simulation(timesteps, parameters = NULL, correlations = NULL, seed = 42)
}
\arguments{

\item{parameters}{a named list of parameters to use}

\item{correlations}{correlation parameters}

\item{seed}{rng seed}

\description{
The main entrypoint for the simulation. run_simulation puts together the
model components and runs the malaria simulation. This currently returns a
dataframe with the number of individuals in each state at each timestep

Warning: the columns of the output dataframe is likely to change as we figure
out what kind of outputs we would like to report from the simulation.
