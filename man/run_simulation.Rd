\description{
Run the simulation for some time given some parameters. This currently
returns a dataframe with the number of individuals in each state at each
timestep.

The resulting dataframe contains the following columns:

timestep: the timestep for the row
infectivity: the infectivity from humans towards mosquitoes
lambda: the effective biting rate on humans (per timestep) (per
species). This defaults to lambda_All
normal_lambda: the effective biting rate on adult humans (per
timestep) (per species). This defaults to normal_lambda_All
FOIM: the force of infection towards mosquitoes (per species)
mu: the death rate of adult mosquitoes (per species)
EIR: the Entomological Inoculation Rate (per timestep, per adult human)
n_bitten: number of humans bitten by an infectious mosquito
n_treated: number of humans treated for clinical or severe malaria this timestep
n_infections: number of humans who get an asymptomatic, clinical or severe malaria this timestep
natural_deaths: number of humans who die from aging
S_count: number of humans who are Susceptible
A_count: number of humans who are Asymptomatic
D_count: number of humans who have the clinical malaria
U_count: number of subpatent infections in humans
Tr_count: number of infections being treated in humans
ica_mean: the mean acquired immunity to clinical infection over the population of humans
icm_mean: the mean maternal immunity to clinical infection over the population of humans
ib_mean: the mean blood immunity to all infection over the population of humans
id_mean: the mean immunity from detection through microscopy over the population of humans
pv: prevalence for humans between an inclusive age range (in timesteps). This
defaults to pv_730_3650. Other prevalence columns can be set with
prevalence_rendering_min_ages and prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
pv_severe: prevalence for severe malaria in humans between an inclusive age range (in timesteps).
These columns can be set with the
severe_prevalence_rendering_min_ages and severe_prevalence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
inc: incidence for humans between an inclusive age range (in timesteps).
incidence columns can be set with
incidence_rendering_min_ages and incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
clin_inc: clinical incidence for humans between an inclusive age range (in timesteps)
clinical incidence columns can be set with
clinical_incidence_rendering_min_ages and clinical_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
inc_severe: severe incidence for humans between an inclusive age range (in
timesteps).
severe incidence columns can be set with
severe_incidence_rendering_min_ages and severe_incidence_rendering_max_ages parameters.
severe_deaths: number of deaths due to severe malaria. severe_enabled must be
set to TRUE
E_count: number of mosquitoes in the early larval stage
L_count: number of mosquitoes in the late larval stage
P_count: number of mosquitoes in the pupal stage
Sm_count: number of adult female mosquitoes who are Susceptible
Pm_count: number of adult female mosquitoes who are incubating
Im_count: number of adult female mosquitoes who are infectious
total_M: number of adult female mosquitoes. Variables with suffixes total_M_# refer to the number of adult
female mosquitoes from the different indicies of the set_species() vector
rate_D_A: rate that humans transition from clinical disease to
asymptomatic
rate_A_U: rate that humans transition from asymptomatic to
subpatent
rate_U_S: rate that humans transition from subpatent to
susceptible
mosquito_deaths: number of adult female mosquitoes who die this timestep
