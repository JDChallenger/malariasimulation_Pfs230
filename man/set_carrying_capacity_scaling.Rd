\title{Parameterise rescaling of the baseline carrying capacity}
\usage{
set_carrying_capacity_scaling(parameters, timesteps, scaler)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{timesteps}{the timesteps when rescaling of baseline carrying capacity will occur}

\item{scaler}{A matrix of scaling factors for baseline carrying capacity where cols must
equal the number of species and rows must align with timesteps}
}
\description{
For a number of reasons we may wish to increase or decrease the carrying capacity
for a mosquito species throughout the simulation. For example:

\strong{Larval source management}.

To simulate larval source management, we may wish to decrease the
baseline carrying capacity. For example, to simulate a 20\% reduction in the
baseline carrying capacity (which may approximate a 20\% reduction in larval
breeding sites) we can set the scaler to 0.8 at the time of implementation.

\strong{Invasive species}

To capture the expansion of an invasive species into a new niche,
we may wish to increase the baseline carrying capacity for that species at the
point of invasion. In this instance we set the scaler to be > 1. Note, that the
invading species proportion must be initialised to >0, so in this case set the
initial proportion at a very low value (e.g 0.005), then scale up the carrying
capacity at the point of invasion by setting the scaler for that species >>1.
