\description{
create_variables creates the human and mosquito variables for
the model. Variables are used to track real data for each individual over
time, they are read and updated by processes

The human variables are defined as:
\itemize{
\item state - the state of a human individual S|D|A|U|Tr
\item birth - an integer representing the timestep when this individual was born
\item last_boosted_* - the last timestep at which this individual's immunity was
boosted for tracking grace periods in the boost of immunity
\item is_severe - yes or no if the individual currently has severe malaria
\item ICM - Maternal immunity to clinical disease
\item IVM - Maternal immunity to severe disease
\item IB  - Pre-erythoctic immunity
\item ICA  - Acquired immunity to clinical disease
\item IVA  - Acquired immunity to severe disease
\item ID - Acquired immunity to detectability
\item zeta - Heterogeneity of human individuals
\item zeta_group - Discretised heterogeneity of human individuals
\item rtss_vaccinated - The timstep of the last rtss vaccination (-1 if there
haven't been any)
\item rtss_boosted  - The timstep of the last rtss booster (-1 if there
haven't been any)
\item rtss_cs - peak antibodies
\item rtss_rho - antibody component variable
\item rtss_ds - short-lived antibody delay variable
\item rtss_dl - long-lived antibody delay variable
\item tbv_vaccinated - The timstep of the last tbv vaccination (-1 if there
haven't been any
\item net_time - The timestep when a net was last put up (-1 if never)
\item spray_time - The timestep when the house was last sprayed (-1 if never)
\item infectivity - The onward infectiousness to mosquitos
\item drug - The last prescribed drug
\item drug_time - The timestep of the last drug
}

Mosquito variables are:
\itemize{
\item mosquito_state - the state of the mosquito, a category Sm|Pm|Im|Unborn
\item species - the species of mosquito, this is a category gamb|fun|arab
}
}
