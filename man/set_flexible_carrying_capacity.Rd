\title{Parameterise custom baseline carrying capacity}
\usage{
set_flexible_carrying_capacity(parameters, carrying_capacity)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{carrying_capacity}{A matrix of baseline carrying capacity values for each
timestep. Cols must equal the number of species and rows must align with timesteps}
}
\description{
For a number of reasons we may wish to provide a custom carrying capacity
for a mosquito species throughout the simulation. For example:

\strong{Larval source management}.

To simulate larval source management, we may wish to decrease the
baseline carrying capacity.

\strong{Invasive species}

To capture the expansion of an invasive species into a new niche,
we may wish to increase the baseline carrying capacity for that species at the
point of invasion. Note, that the invading species proportion must be
initialised to >0, so in this case set the initial proportion at a very
low value (e.g 0.005), then scale up the carrying capacity at the point of invasion.
