\title{Parameterise a bed net strategy}
\usage{
set_bednets(parameters, timesteps, coverages, retention)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{a list of parameters to modify}

\item{timesteps}{the timesteps at which to distribute bednets}

\item{coverages}{the proportion of the human population who receive bednets}

\item{retention}{the average number of timesteps a net is kept for}
}
\description{
The model will distribute bednets at \code{timesteps} to a random
sample of the entire human population. The sample size will be a proportion
of the human population taken from the corresponding \code{coverages}.
The sample \emph{can} contain humans who already have bednets.

All of the sample "use" their bednets on the timestep after they are
distributed. Incomplete usage is not part of this model.

If a human in the sample already has a bednet, their bednet will be replaced
by a new one.

Bednets will be randomly removed each timestep with a rate of \code{1 - exp(-1/retention)}
}
